* multi-monitor not really functional
* focus could be better
* mouse warp is kinda laggy due to the dumb focus loop
* spawned processes close when the parent closes
* tiled windows are raised above floating / unmanaged windows
* tags don't really work. We probably need to minimize / restore windows depending on their visibility
